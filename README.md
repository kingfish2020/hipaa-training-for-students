HIPAA is an important legislative act that has many provisions relating to privacy and data security, and those provisions impact the working lives of all healthcare professionals. Healthcare students will need to follow the HIPAA Rules when they graduate from their course and start employment, so having an understanding of the requirements of HIPAA is useful.
